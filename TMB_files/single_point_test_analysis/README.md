# Single Point Test Analysis Example
Exploration of single point test data

There are 3 files of made-up experimental data, recording the strength of a transmitted FM radio frequency. The <Run Key.xlsx> contains the conditions for the experiments.

### Goals 
1. Read the data files for runs 1-20 and the run key. Do not use the 'dirty' version of the experimental data.
2. Explore the data
3. Analyze the data
4. Present your findings.

### Notes
As you work through this, document the problems and solutions you came up with. Also think about ways to improve future similar experiments. Your previous reading on DOE should come in handy here.

Initially create a branch with <initials> as the branch name. For each week, create a branch off of that with the following name: <initials>_week<number>. Merge your weekly code with your initial branch at the end of the week.
